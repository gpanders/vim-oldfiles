INTRODUCTION                                             *recentf* *:Recentf*

Vim provides a built-in method for viewing your recent file history with the
|:oldfiles| command. This plugin seeks to complement and improve the built-in
command by listing recent files in a separate, navigable buffer, allowing
filtering of files in the recent files list, and keeping the oldfiles list
up-to-date during your Vim session.

To view your recent files, simply use
>
        :Recentf
<
The Recent Files buffer is just a plain old Vim buffer that you can |:sort|,
filter, search, and modify as you like. Modifying this buffer will not change
the |v:oldfiles| variable that recentf uses.
