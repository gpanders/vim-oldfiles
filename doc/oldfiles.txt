INTRODUCTION						    *Oldfiles*

Vim provides a built-in method for viewing your recent file history with the
|:oldfiles| command. This plugin seeks to complement and improve the built-in
command by listing recent files in the quickfix list and keeping the oldfiles
list up-to-date during your Vim session.

							   *:Oldfiles*
:Oldfiles
			Populate the oldfiles list into the quickfix list. The
			number that appears next to the filename in the
			quickfix list is the index of that file in the
			original |:oldfiles| command, allowing you to open the
			given file with |c_#<|.

:Oldfiles[!] {pattern}
			Show oldfiles matching {pattern}. With [!] invert
			the match, showing only oldfiles that DO NOT match
			{pattern}.
			'ignorecase' applies. To overrule it put |/\c| in the
			pattern to ignore case or |/\C| to match case.
			'smartcase' is not used.
